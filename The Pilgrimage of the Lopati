# THE PILGRIMAGE OF THE LOPATI by Kenny

## THE FLIGHT OF THE ARKS

As the stars blinked coldly across the bleak emptiness of space, a Lopati Ark-ship drifted past, its metallic hull gleaming faintly against the vastness. Kalan, the stoic captain of Resonance, stood on the command deck, hands clasped behind his back, gazing out into the dark unknown. It had been many cycles since the destruction of Lopat, their icy homeworld. Now they traveled in exile, seeking haven among the Federation colonies, often struggling to find acceptance. Each day in exile sharpened the tension in the silence that filled the Lopati Ark-ships as they drifted among stars.

Lopat had been a world of survival, a place where every Lopati had learned to adapt to the hostile environment. Beneath the ice-covered surface, Lopati communities had thrived in dark, interconnected caverns, warmed by geothermal energy. They had developed a deep respect for life, for their peoples history, and for the vital resources they had struggled to conserve. The Lopati lived with a loyalty that ran to the bones—a loyalty to one another and to the collective knowledge stored within their sacred Arkhives. This data core was their pride and legacy, a physical testament to Lopats struggles and triumphs, containing stories, knowledge, and even images of a world that no longer existed.

Kalans gaze drifted toward the observation panel where the stars flickered in clusters, and he thought of those ancient days when survival had meant making the impossible possible. Every moment he spent on the bridge brought that weight upon him—the same weight his family had borne as builders and custodians of the Lopatis fragile, carefully managed ecosystem.

A message crackled through the ships intercom, breaking Kalans reverie.

Captain, the trade envoy from Kelzar is requesting docking protocols.

Kalan nodded, turning to his lieutenant, Eska, who stood beside him, her gaze focused yet calm. Her face was weathered and stern, a reflection of the ordeals she had seen. She had been at his side for years, their bond forged in Lopats dark tunnels, where the faintest mistake could mean the difference between life and death.

Prepare the Trillium, he ordered. The Federation outposts will take nothing less.

Eskas eyes darkened slightly as she acknowledged his order. Trillium was their lifeline now, their last currency in a universe that had taken nearly everything from them. It was ironic, Kalan thought, that this strange substance, as volatile and elusive as the Lopati people, had become essential to their survival.

Eskas gaze remained steady, though her voice dropped to a quiet murmur. It feels like were giving pieces of ourselves away, Captain. With each trade, another fragment of Lopat is lost.

Kalans grip tightened slightly. He understood her sentiments all too well. We trade to survive, he replied softly. But survival is only a beginning. Our legacy must endure, even if it means facing those who would exploit us.

## A BOND FORGED IN ICE – FLASHBACK

Years before the destruction of Lopat, Kalan and Eskas paths had crossed in the frozen heart of their world. Kalan had been a young engineer then, gifted with the skills of his ancestors, working to maintain the structures that safeguarded the Lopati. Engineering was his familys legacy, a skill passed down over generations. He was known among the Lopati for his calm, calculating mind—a man who, despite his youth, preferred action over words.

Eska, by contrast, came from a family of scouts and warriors, tasked with braving the hostile depths of Lopats ice caverns. Her role had been one of protection; her training had been rigorous, preparing her for swift defense against the harsh unknown. Eska had grown into a fierce warrior, often taking on challenges that others shied away from. Her fiery spirit, sharp instincts, and absolute loyalty had become her trademarks—and these qualities often drew admiration and fear in equal measure from her peers.

Their fateful meeting occurred on a mission to one of Lopats deepest methane-rich caverns, where geothermal energy could be tapped. Both Kalan and Eska knew the risks: these ancient caves were susceptible to ice shifts and methane surges. Kalan had been tasked with surveying the energy field, while Eska and her team provided protection.

As the mission progressed, a tremor struck, and the walls of the cavern split open with a thunderous crack. A wave of ice and rock surged down, catching Eska and pinning her beneath the debris. The others scrambled toward the exit, but Kalan alone turned back. Through the haze and dust, he spotted her, trapped and fading fast, and moved without hesitation to dig her free. With Eska barely conscious, he hoisted her onto his back and pushed forward, feeling every step as the cavern walls shifted ominously around him. They reached the surface as the cave collapsed behind them.

From that moment on, Kalan and Eska were bound by an unspoken trust, a mutual reliance that had seen them through the hardest days. Together, they became leaders, each drawing on the others strengths as the asteroid crisis loomed. They would need that bond now, more than ever.

## SHADOWS OF THE FEDERATION

The Federation outpost on Kelzar loomed into view, a sprawling metallic web brimming with trade ships. Kelzars leaders were opportunistic, and the Federation outposts viewed the Lopati with a mixture of curiosity and disdain. To them, the Lopati were remnants of a world already lost, outsiders who had nothing to offer but their strange, volatile Trillium. Lopati culture, their history, the tragedy of Lopats destruction—all of this held no value to them.

As they disembarked, Kalans diplomatic team, led by Eska, carried crates of Trillium to the meeting point. Every step across the crowded bazaar brought back memories of Lopats close-knit tunnels—the dimly lit passageways, the community gatherings, the sense of shared purpose. Here, among the bustling Federation vendors, she felt that contrast deeply; every eye that lingered on them saw only what they could take, what they could gain.

Eska and her team made their way through the bustling market until they reached a shadowed alcove, where a tall figure stood waiting. Marek, Kelzars trade official, waited with a smirk, his gaze flickering to the Trillium as they approached.

You bring Trillium, yes? Mareks voice was smooth, practiced. But not just any Trillium. Ive heard tales of the Lopati stock—pure, undiluted, worth more than any Federation refinery could produce.

Eska met his gaze with a cold, unflinching stare. We bring Trillium, but only if the terms are fair, she replied in a measured tone.

Mareks smirk deepened. Terms will be… negotiable. But first, a taste of what you carry.

Eska held up a vial of Trillium gel, letting the faint glow cast a warm hue over the dim alcove. This vial, she knew, was more than currency—it was the result of hours of grueling extraction and refinement, a physical representation of their peoples struggle and survival.

Mareks gaze lingered on the vial with a hunger that disturbed her. His fingers twitched toward a concealed weapon as he murmured, I could take it all, you know.

Eskas voice remained calm but laced with warning. And risk the wrath of our people? We are few, but our knowledge is boundless.

Marek hesitated, then laughed softly, his hand withdrawing. Very well, then. Lets discuss… terms.

## MINING THE HEART OF THE ASTEROIDS

Mining Trillium had become the Lopatis lifeline, though it was an art fraught with peril. In the asteroid fields surrounding their new territories, Lopati mining crews spent months on isolated asteroids, carving out raw Trillium from the rocky surfaces. The veins ran deep, glowing with chaotic energy, like molten veins of magma. But Trillium was dangerous, and a single misstep could release a pulse that could mutate or kill those nearby.

Kalan himself had crafted the Lopatis methods of Trillium extraction, inspired by the geothermal systems he once maintained on Lopat. Each mining suit was designed to contain energy emissions, allowing the miners to work close to the Trillium without suffering mutations. The miners lives depended on precision, discipline, and control—a wrong move could destabilize an entire vein, causing explosions or energy spikes.

Eska had joined many mining expeditions, and she often supervised the younger crew members who were new to Trillium work. She remembered the time a young miner had gotten too close to an unstable vein, the energy bursting into an iridescent flare just as she pulled him back. The memory lingered, a reminder of her duty to protect her people. She had been willing to risk her life then, and she would do it again without hesitation.

## THE ARKHIVES SECRETS

In each Ark-ship, an Arkhive was maintained—a sacred data core crafted from Lopats last remnants. The Arkhives contained every piece of Lopati history, culture, and knowledge. Here, stored within carefully carved data stones and encoded files, were the stories of ancestors, scientific records, and survival techniques developed over centuries. The Arkhives were more than records; they were the very soul of the Lopati people.

Eska and Kalan often found themselves returning to the Arkhive, sometimes for solace, sometimes for guidance. The chamber was dark, silent, yet filled with a sense of timelessness that bound them to Lopat. Every Lopati had come to see the Arkhives as their last link to their home, and every journey to Lopats ruins was a pilgrimage of honor.

Once, in the quiet of the Arkhive chamber, Kalan murmured, We carry more than memory here. We carry the heart of our world. His voice was low, reverent.

Eskas reply was equally soft, her words fierce with pride. We may wander, but we are Lopati. And that will never change.

Together, they were not just leaders but guardians of a culture whose roots ran deep, whose strength had endured even as the world around them crumbled.

## THE TAINTED ARKHIVE

Back on Resonance, Kalan awaited word from Eska when a warning alert flashed across the ships control panels. Anomalous energy signatures appeared in the rear sectors, dangerously close to the Arkhive chamber.

Kalan The voice of a junior officer, Thalen, broke through the intercom. Unstable energy readings from the Arkhive Somethings interfering with the core systems. We cant contain it

Kalan felt a cold knot form in his stomach. The Arkhive was the heart of their culture—their survival and identity depended on it. He rushed to the chamber, where Lopati engineers worked frantically to stabilize the glowing core. The room pulsed with erratic energy, and the usual steady hum of the Arkhive had grown into a chaotic thrum.

Eska arrived moments later, her face drawn with tension. Captain, she said, her voice taut, Its the circuitry. Marek must have sabotaged what he traded us. Its destabilizing the Arkhive itself.

Kalans jaw clenched as he glanced at the panel showing the compromised components. It was obvious now: the circuits Marek had bartered—offered under the guise of being high-efficiency energy regulators—had introduced erratic signals into the core. What should have been a reliable system was now a dangerous threat to the entire ship.

That lying scavenger, Kalan muttered through gritted teeth. He planned this.

The Arkhives energy field grew more unstable by the second, and Kalan knew that hesitation could cost them everything. His voice cut through the tension with the calm authority that had seen them through countless crises. We need to isolate the corrupted systems and eject them into space. Get it out of the Arkhives network before the entire core fails.

Together, Kalan and Eska coordinated the emergency protocol. Engineers worked swiftly under their commands, detaching the compromised components and sealing the sections of circuitry that had been corrupted. Finally, with a deep metallic groan, the corrupted modules were jettisoned into the vacuum.

As the room fell silent, the Arkhives core stabilized, its pulse returning to a steady rhythm. Kalan let out a long breath, though the anger simmering beneath his calm remained.

Eska turned to him, her voice low but fierce. This was no accident. Marek wanted to cripple us.

Kalan nodded, his gaze hardening. And he nearly succeeded. But well make sure this never happens again.

## THE RETURN HOME

As Mareks fleet emerged from the dark void of space, their formation was an imposing wall of predatory vessels bristling with weapons. The Lopati Ark-ships, though fewer in number and smaller, moved swiftly into position, forming a defensive line against the encroaching threat. The Lopati crew worked with the precision of those who had known nothing but survival. Every movement was deliberate; every strategy, sharpened by necessity.

Kalans voice echoed across the Ark-ships comm channels, calm yet firm, a steadying force amidst the rising tension. Hold formation. Let them come to us. We fight as one.

On the bridge of Resonance, Eska stood at his side, her gaze locked on the approaching enemy. Her fists clenched at her sides as she studied the larger ships of Mareks fleet, their sleek hulls gleaming with stolen Federation technology. Theyll try to break us apart, isolate the smaller ships, she muttered, her voice low and tight with anticipation.

Theyll find were not so easily broken, Kalan replied, his tone carrying the same quiet determination that had saved countless lives in the past.

With a sharp motion, Mareks fleet surged forward, a tidal wave of black metal and weapon fire. Their plasma cannons ignited, streaks of energy slicing through the void. The first volley struck the Lopati line, and the reinforced hulls of the Ark-ships trembled but held. Sparks erupted along the flanks of Resonance, and Kalans crew scrambled to adjust power to the shields.

Evasive maneuvers Rotate shield focus Kalan barked.

The Lopati ships responded with eerie synchronicity, their movements a testament to years of surviving asteroid storms and Federation hostility. Where Mareks fleet relied on brute force, the Lopati countered with tactics—precision strikes and relentless coordination.

The smaller Lopati escort ships darted forward, weaving between enemy fire like shadows against the stars. Their weapons, though less powerful, targeted Mareks key systems with surgical accuracy, disabling engines and weapon arrays. One enemy frigate buckled under a focused barrage from two Lopati ships, its hull splitting apart in a silent explosion that sent debris spinning into the void.

On Resonance, Eskas voice cut through the comms. Focus fire on their left flank. Theyre pulling resources to reinforce their right. Break their line before they regroup

Kalan nodded in approval as the Ark-ships adjusted, their massive bulk deceptively nimble as they shifted formation. The Lopatis adaptability was their greatest strength. While Mareks fleet sought to overwhelm them, the Lopati struck back with calculated ferocity, exploiting every weakness with precision.

Aboard Mareks flagship, the trade official sneered as he watched the battle unfold on his tactical display. They think theyre clever, he muttered to his lieutenant. But their numbers wont save them. Deploy the auxiliaries. Surround them and cut off their retreat.

From the darkness, a second wave of Mareks smaller ships surged forward, aiming to encircle the Lopati. For a moment, it seemed the tide was turning. The encircling ships poured fire into the Ark-ships shields, cracks appearing in their energy barriers. A Lopati escort ship took a direct hit, its engines erupting in a plume of flame.

Weve lost the Aurora a voice cried through the comms.

Eskas jaw tightened as the loss hit home, but she forced herself to focus. Kalan, theyre boxing us in. We need to break their formation now.

Kalans eyes narrowed as he studied the tactical display. His mind raced, calculating their options. Then, his voice rang out with resolve. Redirect power from auxiliary systems to propulsion. All ships, form a spearhead and punch through their weakest point—starboard midline. If were going to break their hold, we do it together.

The Lopati ships shifted seamlessly, the Ark-ships leading the charge with their reinforced hulls absorbing the brunt of the assault. Plasma and ion fire rained down on them, the shields flaring brightly under the impact, but the Lopati pressed forward.

As they closed in on Mareks starboard line, Kalan gave the order. Concentrate fire—cripple their lead ship

The Lopati unleashed a coordinated barrage, their weapons converging on the enemys lead vessel. The ships shields faltered under the onslaught, and within moments, a massive explosion ripped through its hull. The shockwave destabilized the surrounding ships, creating a gap in Mareks formation.

There Push through Eska shouted, her voice fierce with determination.

The Lopati spearhead drove into the gap, the Ark-ships tearing through the disorganized enemy line. As they emerged on the other side, the Lopati escort ships swung around, flanking Mareks fleet and turning the tables.

On Mareks flagship, the trade officials confidence began to waver. Pull back Regroup Theyre—

A concentrated strike from Resonance cut off his command, the blast severing the ships communication arrays. The Lopati capitalized on the confusion, disabling ship after ship with relentless precision.

By the time Mareks remaining forces limped into retreat, the Lopati line had reformed, their ships battered but unbroken. The void fell silent once more, the wreckage of the battle drifting aimlessly among the stars.

 

## THE LEGACY OF THE ARKHIVE

As the adrenaline of battle faded, the Lopati gathered in solemn reflection. Their losses were heavy, but their unity had prevailed. The Arkhives remained safe, their knowledge and culture intact.

Kalan addressed his people through the comms, his voice steady but heavy with emotion. We have lost many, but we have not fallen. Each of you carries the legacy of Lopat within you. We are Lopati—resilient, unbreakable. Bound by more than memory.

Eska stood beside him, her voice rising alongside his. Let them come for our Trillium. Let them covet our Arkhive. But they will never understand it. They will never be us.

As the Ark-ships resumed their course, drifting once more into the vast unknown, the Lopati knew they had faced the worst and emerged stronger. Together, bound by their shared purpose and history, they would ensure their legacy endured.
