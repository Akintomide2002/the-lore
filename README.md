> *"Life is the way the universe speaks to us... And now we can speak back."* ---Notes from a Trilium Researcher
  
Elsewhere in the galaxy, far into the future, the Altans---an elder, superior race---discovered Trilium on their home planet. In its raw state, Trilium is the most bio-reactive substance known. When exposed to genetic material, Trilium causes mutations and alterations at an unparalleled rate, wreaking chaos in the genetic code. The Altans sought to understand the effects of Trilium and eventually mastered its power and possibilities, developing Triactor technology that allowed them to safely and precisely administer Trilium on themselves. This was a genetic Pandora's Box for their race.

The Altans used Trilium and Triactor Technology to eliminate disease, genetic defects, and even slow down aging. But there was a catch. Trilium's effects were only temporary. Without constant exposure to Trilium, any genetic aging and disease would re-emerge. For the Altans, Trilium and Triactor Tech stood between where life and death meet.

Because Trilium was so vital, with so many uses, the Altans used moreand more of it, and they realized it was a limited resource and eventually it would run out. As a superior race, they realized the repercussions of losing this substance that had become so vital to their civilization. After a few skirmishes and growing turmoil as factions fought for control of the dwindling supplies, the Altans knew they needed to find other sources of Trilium.

So they turned to the stars---and that, too, required Trilium, so they could modify themselves to survive on other worlds, in other environments.

The Altans used their Triactor technology as they journeyed outward in every direction. The Great Expansion began, not just a desperate search for the vital substance but a quest to build a galactic consortium. During their search, the Altans found many other intelligent races, they found us---and they shared everything.

The other races found they could apply Triactor tech to their species as well, enhancing their physical abilities, allowing them to survive on alien worlds, extending their lifespans. Thus, more and more Trilium was needed.

Trilium has thus far been found in substantial quantities on six other planets---Eyeke, Kavian, Magor, Naron, Neri, Veles. Some of these sources were discovered by the Altans, while others were found by different races as the expansion continued and galactic civilization grew more intertwined among the major civilizations. Commercial entities that exploit Trilium sources and modify Triactor tech have become the most powerful economic forces in the federation.

What we have now is a vast galactic federation run by Megacorps, with powerful Syndicates controlling the major Trilium extraction operations on the six planets. The search for other Trilium deposits continues at a breakneck pace across countless star systems.

While numerous races and life forms have been discovered across these alien worlds, the primary players---in addition to the original ancient Altan race---are the Elgems, the Khaureds, the Onoros race, the Lopati race, and Humans.

These races interact in countless ways, with businesses, conflicts, alliances, and schemes. The search for other worlds, other races---and other sources of Trilium---continues to expand the galaxy.

## TRILIUM
Trilium is a bioreactive substance that can be manipulated and controlled through Triactor technology. In its basic, raw form, it is powerful and volatile, and quite dangerous. Some natural genetic changes might be beneficial after being exposed to Trilium, but it's Russian roulette. Each time the result is wildly different. But the "safety net" of Triactor tech allows the user to control, predict, and regulate the massive effects of Trilium.

Using specifically designed cartridges in an implanted Triactor device (tailored to each alien race), one can deliver Trilium to create specific beneficial health effects, to allow the ability to breathe and survive on other alien worlds, to increase strength or endurance, and numerous other abilities. Different Triactor cartridges provide different effects, which are species dependent.
- **Survival on other planets:** Traveling to another planet used to be prohibitively complicated, involving space suits, life support, balancing atmospheres for all of the different walks of life. It made inter-species commerce and cultural exchange not only difficult but impossible. Trilium changed that. By standardizing its application for multi-atmospheric living, a boom came where species could coexist without being separated by a life-saving pane of glass keeping their atmosphere in and your atmosphere out. With the proper Triactor cartridge, you can survive on a world that is not your own.

- **Health benefits and life extension:** Trilium slows aging, but doesn\'t stop it. As you age, you require more Trilium to stabilize your genetic code, which is constantly trying to experience a natural genetic death. Eventually, you are too poor to live on, and you die. Trilium isn\'t a drug in the sense that you get sick if you withdraw. For all beings, Trilium eventually becomes the only thing standing between them and inevitable death.

- **Physical enhancements:** Triactor cartridges can enhance your strength, speed, endurance to cold or heat, mental acuity, reaction speed. Multiple benefits for survival, for workers, for advanced military or mercenary applications.

Trilium is the god particle. It is the naturally occuring resource that can control life itself. And there is only so much of it to go around.

We don\'t know how to solve the mystery of life, but nothing would be as important as *solving the mystery of death\... if we could*.

### Trilium and Weaponsmithing
In the early period after the creation of the Federation when the first of the Frontier planets was discovered, colonists quickly found that the blaster weapons they typically used to protect themselves against predators functioned erratically or not at all. The Altans tested numerous theories and found conclusive evidence that Trilium’s fluctuating resonance destabilized the energy produced when charging or trying to fire a blaster, resulting in misfire, rapid dissipation, or in the worst case scenario disintegration of the weapon itself (and likely whoever was holding it). This meant that anyone using Triactor technology, powered as it was by Trilium fuel cells, was incapable of utilizing such weapons - and also were incapable of being harmed by them as their proximity to Trilium caused any energy bolts to dissipate before making contact.

With no foreseeable workaround for the problem the fledgling Federation Congress voted to  abandon the development of personal and planet-side blaster weaponry, and individuals in need of offensive weapons were relegated to more traditional staples such as swords and projectile-firing guns.
#### Biometal
A monastic sect of Altans on the planet of Eyeke - known colloquially as “Greys” owing to their light greyish skin tone and the muted colors of both their clothing and their settlements, and renowned for creating all manner of weaponry from Waxon, the toughest mineral known and very hard to mine or shape without using specially tailored cutting technology - began to experiment attempting to infuse Waxon and other metals with Trilium in order to enhance the properties of the final product. These experiments were ultimately successful with the resultant alloys possessing a modicum of Trilium’s extreme bioreactivity, and capable of causing unpredictable rapid onset genetic mutation to any organic material that they came into contact with. Given such mutagenic properties, these alloys were named “biometals”.
#### M-Casters & Biometal Forgemasters
The Eyekese Altans forged their new biometals into a variety of bladed weapons including daggers, axes and particularly swords. The process of forging such items was costly, time-consuming, and incredibly hazardous, so only the best of the Altan smiths were permitted to carry out what they termed Biometal manipulation. Collectively they were referred to as Biometal Forgemasters - or colloquially as Splicers - and the special weapons they produced were given the umbrella name of M-Casters.

Not content with the randomized effects caused to opponents by Trilium-infused alloys, the Forgemasters sought mastery over Biometal’s mutagenic properties, modifying Triactor technology to allow it to be applied to the shaft or handle of a weapon and thus restrain Trilium’s chaotic resonance in a similar way as when applied to individuals. This facilitated the creation of a suite of weapons with very specific properties, including the legendary Galactic Fireblade - a bastard sword forged with a liquid core of Trilium-infused lava from the famous Azingoth volcano on Magor - and the brightly-glowing Star Fire Sword - a shortsword purportedly created from an alloy including an unknown metallic element found in a meteorite crater.
#### The Sandmasters of Neri
A notable early client of the Splicers was a Nerinese Syndicate made up of a group of desert tribes. After centuries of war and attrition, the tribes had come together to present a unified front in the face of the arrival of Federation Syndicates and Megacorps seeking to colonize Neri, and exploit its varied resources - particularly Trilium - for their own gain. Setting aside grievances passed down through generations for so long that the true origins of the rift-causing disagreements between tribes were lost to history, the Sandmasters’ Syndicate built itself into a force to be reckoned with.

As an enduring, ritualistic sign of their unity, they sent an ambassador to the Altans of Eyeke to request the manufacture of a set of special Biometal spears, containing rare and precious grains of soul sand from the sacred temple that members of all tribes often made pilgrimages to, and where the creation of the Sandmasters’ Syndicate had taken place. The Altans agreed, and though the cost was steep, a spear was forged for each tribal leader. These Sandmaster Spears are said to be capable of commanding the sands of the Nerinese desert itself, and incidences of sandstorms springing up seemingly out of nowhere to hinder Megacorp convoys and encroaching groups from other Syndicates, are attributed to use of this power by the Sandmasters.
#### The Necromancers' Guild
Another organization that immediately saw potential in the invention of Biometals was the famous Necromancers’ Guild, a multi-racial group dedicated solely to finding a method of reversing death itself. They viewed Trilium as the fundamental key not just to reanimation of the dead, but truly bringing them back to life. Their activities were viewed with wariness, and the Altans in particular - having a wealth of experience experimenting with Trilium and dealing with many unwanted or unprecedented side effects - monitored them closely.

Over a period of decades, wealthy members of the Necromancers’ Guild approached the Splicers with blueprints of what they deemed “fatality reversal devices”, which were in fact a variety of weapons infused with Trilium and concoctions of different elements, the particulars of which the Guild guarded incredibly closely - and the Splicers kept to themselves for reasons beyond mere client confidentiality.

The stories of these weapons being employed in attempts to bring the dead back to life abound across the Federation - notably because none of them actually function as designed, though they possess impressive capabilities nonetheless - with tales such as that of the Necromancers’ Hammer being used to try to reanimate one of the fabled Storm Giants, whispers of an M-Caster known as the Dagger of Creation capable of creating a temporary simulacrum of the wielder out of molten lava, and revelations about the powerful curative properties of the Healing Blade best the most widely disseminated. In spite of their failures, the Necromancers cling doggedly to their quest “to master the mystery that is death”, as their official Guild slogan reads.
#### Ranged Weapons Revisited: R-Casters
Enterprising individuals across the Federation saw Biometal not just as material for producing close combat weaponry, but also a new evolution of ranged weapons capable of inflicting genetic devastation from a safe distance. Lacking access to the refined techniques and advanced technology utilized by the Splicers, several organizations have nonetheless managed to design crude Biometal production mechanisms, and also methods of melting down existing Biometal weapons, using both to produce a range of Trilium-infused bullets & arrow/bolt-heads, and a series of necessarily reinforced guns, bows and crossbows - known collectively as R-Casters - capable of firing them with some degree of reliability and accuracy.

The ammo lacks the Triactor technology that restrains and guides the mutagenic impact of Trilium, and as such the effects on living organisms are unpredictable. R-casters are also somewhat prone to issues of instability, owing to the fact that the Trilium infusion process is being carried out using inferior technology, and there are gruesome reports of explosive misfires causing entire military squads to die horrifically as runaway mutation wrought havoc on their bodies.

Various factions within the Federation - including the Altans - disdain the use of such technology. However, other powerful factions such as the Khaureds routinely equip their military with R-casters, arguing that in scenarios where they are protecting land-based convoys or conducting ground assaults, ranged weapons are more effective at getting the job done successfully, and in spite of the instability issues are generally better at guaranteeing the lives of the Khaured soldiers & mercenaries wielding them.
## THE PRIMARY RACES
### ALTANS
The Altans, a superior ancient race, were the first to discover Trilium and develop basic Triactor technology to control it. Their planet used to be a primary source, but they have since exhausted its supply. As a result, they searched among the stars and made contact with the first races on other planets where they believed Trilium could be mined.

Their world, Alta, has a perfect climate and fertile soil. Early in their civilization, the race had plenty of food, no serious predators, so they were able to develop their minds and have lofty goals.

As population pressures grew, Altans learned to make more food, to purify their water, to maintain their environment. Altan genetic scientists understood DNA and cellular structure on a deep and intimate level. Their climate scientists were able to control the weather.

Then they discovered Trilium and “tamed” it with Triactor tech so their race benefited greatly from it. The Altans could truly reach their potential. But as more and more Altans became dependent on Trilium, their supplies dwindled, and they had to search for other sources among the stars. [see above]

Previously their astronomers had studied the universe as an intellectual exercise. They found other planets and learned of other intelligent species, but none of these other planets seemed as pleasant as Alta (some of them very harsh), so they had no need to go there in person, so they contented themselves with being nothing more than armchair explorers. They studied with high-powered telescopes and eventually sent probes, learning more about these other strange worlds. It seemed too risky for them to colonize elsewhere. (Like the people of Krypton, highly advanced but homebodies.)

Eventually through population pressures, stresses on Alta’s environment, and intellectual pressures that encouraged extensive research into more advanced uses of Triactor technology, the Altan elders came to the realization that they could use Trilium to modify their bodies to survive on other hostile planets. The Altans were a biologically sensitive race - the planetary environment, the atmosphere, the climate, amino acids in the food; all needed to be exactly right for their species. This made sustaining colonization difficult, but Trilium and Triactor tech allowed them to alter their very genetic structure in ways that would let them  live “natively” on new worlds.

This plan was much more extreme than their previous uses of Trilium, requiring fundamental genetic alterations. At first they bit off more than they could chew, and unfortunately their initial “clumsy” (by their standards) experiments to create Altan hybrids for exploration and colonization resulted in the birth of an “abomination” splinter race. [see below]

With painful lessons learned the Altans eventually stabilized this technology, and decided to share it with the rest of the known universe, thereby creating the federation and the Galactic Congress as they brought many more alien civilizations together.

The original world of Alta is the center of the Galactic Congress (like Trantor or Coruscant), as the elder race can live there comfortably. Because they are the forefathers of Triactor technology (which all space-faring races use now) they have been able to spread their influence outward as well, living comfortably on many planets.

The Altans are ethereal, willowy, elvish, with a hint of the Close Encounter grays, or the Kaminoans from Star Wars. They have an aura of intelligence and benevolence about them, as if they are Buddhist masters.

After living among so many other races, though, some of the Altans have learned and adapted too well. By “going native,” some of the Altans have learned baser instincts from other cultures, the drives and greed that make other combative races succeed.
#### The Abominations
When the Altans first tinkered with their DNA and experimented with volatile raw Trilium, they tried to create a more robust and resilient version of their species for exploring the galaxy. These modified Altans would be able to settle on other worlds that the more delicate original race could not endure. They could conform to the needs of any planet to which they were exposed. Their skin would be tougher, their lungs might process oxygen better, and they could withstand extremes of temperature or contaminants. This would allow the new Altans to settle virtually anywhere.

And this offshoot species could extract Trilium for the original Altans.

In this wildly shifting cellular structure, though, something went wrong, and the adaptation went out of control. All the children from this modified race began to fail, suffering terrible genetic diseases as their bodies shaped and reshaped themselves. Their form became a living and changing cancerous tumor, and the disease growth affected their minds as well.

The modified Altans were indeed resilient and strong, and they became predators. They fought faster, their muscles were stronger, their skin tougher. Their bodies shifted constantly, a boiling wave of wild, fast-growing tumors. (something like Swamp Thing.) But they could regrow and become super-versions of other races to whose DNA they were exposed. The abomination race was like a nightmarish disease, and the Altans were frightened. 

In a desperate move, they tried to contain their created race, intending to eradicate them all. But the abominations were smart and fast. Some of them escaped and fled Alta. The abominations have not been heard from since. The Altans are now convinced that the writhing, rampant genetic modifications must have killed the escapees, that the abomination race is surely extinct. 

Out of horror and embarrassment, the Altans expunged all records of them from their histories and databases, but rumors persist, and some believe they are still out there.
##### Commentary
*This is background information and we plan to introduce rumors of this, but expand on the abominations as a major threat in later expansions and releases.*
### ELGEMS
The Elgems are small-statured, swift, silent, innocuous-looking and easily underestimated. At first glance, you might compare them to Ewoks or Spielberg’s Gremlins (but if you feed them after midnight…)

Elgems keep a very low profile. They don’t strive for riches, they don’t crave political power, they don’t want to be famous. They want to be unnoticed. If you meet one at a party, it’ll be a pleasant experience, but the conversation won’t amount to much more than “nice weather today, isn’t it?”

For those who know, however, the Elgems' very blandness and invisibility is their greatest asset. They are swift and deadly. They are highly intelligent. They have a bone structure more cartilage than solid bone, and they can fit into the smallest spaces. They can slip through the shadows, and they can move unseen across rooftops. They can infiltrate—and they can kill. For the right price and for those who know how to contact them on the black market, they are the best assassins and spies. They also work as private investigators. Wherever you see them, you can bet they are not just there for the scenery; they are on some mission.

The Elgems come from a forested planet—imagine huge, dense aspen groves. They evolved like koalas, to eat only a narrow range of specific food, a type of mushroom or shelf fungus that grows at the base of the aspen groves. On Elgem, though, they are not the apex predators—there is a very successful and very hungry predator that lives at ground level, and almost a third of the Elgems are devoured before they reach adulthood (like sea turtles hatching, trying to make it into the water). 

The predators are extremely difficult to kill, and not corporeal as we understand it—a vampire plasma cloud (ref the blood-sucking white mist from the classic Trek episode “Obsession”) The vampire plasma is like a low-lying mist and cannot rise very high in the air, but it slinks along the ground, where the vital food source grows.

That’s why the intelligent Elgems have not been able to fight back or wipe the plasma clouds out. But Elgems have evolved to be smart, fast, and they know how to hide in the shadows, flit from treetrunk to treetrunk. The entire agricultural structure of Elgem is based on daredevil lighting-strike harvest raids, where Elgems will dart in and gather the food, then dash away before the predators come. They are swift and adaptable, and sneaky.

Elgem society flourishes in the upper levels of the trees, with elaborate interconnected tree houses and walkways. When among themselves, they have a vibrant and colorful culture, with lots of ribbons and bright clothes, because they are safe up in the upper levels.

In the federation, the Elgems are intentionally nondescript, wearing drab clothes and keeping their head down, like Downton Abbey servants. They are there, but not noticed. However, when they are in private, they can “let their hair down” and show their vibrant colors to one another, but very rarely to strangers. Elgems even have a tucked ruff around their necks and shoulders, which pops out in intense colors—like mating plumage or mandrill coloration—when they are safe and in private. (Imagine a conservative businessman who always wears suit and tie, but in private when he takes his shirt off, he’s got a complete tattoo sleeve.)

Because Elgems need their specific food source, any Elgem character would NEED to have a supply of the fungus from the home planet.**
##### Commentary
*Some story possibilities with this race*

—an Elgem character is with a large family group to harvest food, but his family is wiped out by a swarm of predators. [Harvesting the food source is almost like an episode of Squid Game.] He knows that other parts of his large extended family will starve, unless he leaves his home world and hires out his services to be a spy or assassin. He could be hired to infiltrate or gather intelligence for (or against) the warlord who hires a Khaured mercenary character).

—a very rich Trilium deposit is found on Elgem, but it is in an area infested with the gaseous predators. An Elgem hires a mercenary team of humans and maybe Khaureds to face off against the predators and lure them away so the miners can extract the Trilium…and the only way to lure them away is to use other Elgems as bait.
### KHAUREDS
Khaur is a high-gravity planet, dense atmosphere, some toxic gasses. Non-Khaureds can survive only short periods of time there (a little like Pandora), so Trilium and Triactor tech enhancements are vital for anyone wanting to go there.

The Khaureds are stocky and have thick pebbly, almost-impenetrable skin, like rhinoceros hide. Because they come from a high-gravity planet, they are very strong and they make excellent mercenaries and bodyguards. They have a third eye in the center of their forehead, which stays closed except in combat situations or inner mental journeys [see below].

Though they are very strong workers, the Khaured personality is very focused and driven, with a great “sense of purpose.” Before Khaureds do anything, they have to be convinced that it’s worth doing. As mercenaries, they don’t just go to the highest bidder. Not only do you have to meet their fee, you have to convince them that your cause is something worth doing, that your war is worth fighting. The same goes for serving as contract bodyguards. If a rich or powerful ambassador wants to have Khaured security, they have to convince the Khaureds that the customer is someone worth protecting.

Khaureds aren’t impossible to convince—they just need to have a reason. Thus, when you hire them, you really need to have a good sales pitch.

Female Khaureds are the brokers and negotiators. A Khaured couple is like a champion boxer and his agent. Khaured females meet with prospective customers or warlords to negotiate the reasons and the pay. Other groups of Khaureds have different brokers, and they can be convinced to go on opposite sides of a war, because in a war each side believes they are right and have convincing arguments for this. Some might work for the Syndicates, some might be bodyguards for the central galactic Senate, or the Megaorps.

Khaureds are strong and relentless fighters. They prefer to use hand weapons and personal combat, though they are also excellent marksmen. Their third eye allows them to triangulate perfectly. They are cool and deadly when they fight, seeing it as a job and a purpose; they don’t lose their temper and become berserkers…but you don’t want to face one in battle.

Political-class Khaureds are powerful, focused leaders and intensely loyal and driven to meet their aims. This makes them ruthless, driven businessmen, equivalent to mob bosses. Tony Soprano would fit in well with the Khaureds. They are powerful leaders of Syndicates, driven to mine Trilium on the six planets and get more for Khaur, by whatever means. [see the Khaured-Onoros “alliance” discussion below.]
#### Khaured Philosophers
Some of the Khaureds push against the ruthless and driven aspects of their race, and members of their sect are deeply intellectual, creative, and philosophical. They have built fabulous and legendary retreats, like Tibetan monasteries. Some Khaureds aspire to create new things, supposedly as a balance to the universe, to make up for what their mercenaries break and destroy.

The Khaureds have temples with singing crystals, ancient libraries filled with experiences, they have artwork locked away and only visible to those who have reached a certain level of enlightenment because to the uninitiated, the beauty of such art would drive them blind or mad.

Because Khaur has these ethereal spectacles and great enlightenment, people want to visit there and experience for themselves, and so they must use a lot of Trilium and Triactor cartridges to survive in the high monasteries. 

Khaured gurus meditate and seek inspiration or enlightenment by closing their two eyes and only opening the third eye, seeing into their inner realm.
##### Commentary:
—someone goes to the greatest Shangri-La monastery in order to steal an art masterpiece (but it is so profound, legend says it will burn his eyes out if he’s not careful). 

—a fanatic wants to destroy what they consider to be blasphemous texts in one of the libraries.

—a Khaured goes out to become a new mercenary or bodyguard and works with his mate or sister to broker a deal to guard a great warlord (maybe meets with both rivals to decide which he wants to commit to), and becomes conscripted as a big soldier. The war has a very shady moral foundation.
### ONOROS
In their search for Trilium and to enlist other alien races, the Khaureds discovered the Onoros, a race of fast-breeding all-purpose workers, much like drones. Enlisting Onoros workers suddenly makes the Khaured industrial magnates wealthier and more productive, because they have an army of ready and willing workers to jump into every industrial site. 

But to the rest of the federation, the Khaureds are very secretive about where the Onoros come from—treating their “allies” as a secret weapon.

The Onoros worker caste are humanoid with round, noseless faces, a pair of enlarged eyes capable of accurate vision in near complete darkness, small pointy-tipped ears thought to be among the more sound-sensitive of Federation races, and a very small pair of antennae that it is speculated facilitate telepathy. They are small statured and can eat just about anything, needing only small quantities of sustenance due to their low metabolic rate and a lightweight musculature that requires little energy. 

They can thrive in a broad temperature spectrum, from cold to hot, from wet to dry, and breathe a variety of atmospheres - and these abilities are enhanced by the larger, specially designed exosuits based on Khaured technology that they use for many activities. Between their natural resilience and the protective encasement of their exosuits, Onoros can go to a wide range of worlds with minimal Trilium required for survival or bodily maintenance.

In addition to the drone workers, there are separate physical forms of two other castes: Directors and Diplomats. These castes have arisen in response to two major Khaured needs, with the Directors being created to assist Khaureds in overseeing increasingly large work-teams of Drones, and the Diplomats being introduced as a response to pressure from the Galactic Senate about the lack of Onoros representation. 

Onoros generally have quiet personalities, docile, not much emotional range. Their intellect is the definition of average, because they’re all the same. They are content because they all commune with a higher power; they are a hive mind.

Onoros are telepathically connected to their Maxa, a genderless version of a hive queen or overmind. The Onoros are individuals, but they consider themselves part of a larger purpose, a larger race. They draw a mellow comfort from their connection to the Maxa.

To outsiders, the Maxa seems like a deity, a controlling innocuous mind whose concerns are far beyond and separate from the Megacorps or the Syndicates. Although the Onoro representatives of the Maxa are part of the Galactic Congress, and they vote, they are never firebrands. Their race just quietly takes its fees as workers, and are generally considered to be quite wealthy, not known to engage in any high risk endeavors.

However, some worry that the mysterious Onoros Maxa might have greater schemes, with Drones scattered throughout the inhabited galaxy as workers for both Megacorps and Syndicates, like pieces being put into place, as if preparing for some malevolent scheme…
#### The Khaured-Onoros "Alliance"
Up until a century ago, the Khaureds were a race of average importance in the galactic empire. Their mercenaries and bodyguards were popular. Their artwork, poetry, and philosophy from their monastic sect gained some popularity. But they weren’t on anybody’s Top Ten list. Khaureds worked on the six planets to extract Trilium, usually as part of multiracial conglomerates and mining companies.

A hundred years ago, though, that all changed. A new Khaured Syndicate ambitiously went to work mining Trilium with a mysterious new work force—the Onoros drones. The Khaureds told the federation they had discovered a new sentient race and now the two races have a firm alliance. The work gangs of Onoros drones proved to be so successful and so productive that the Khaured upstarts produced more Trilium than their rivals, and their syndicate thrived. Other races immediately began to take notice, and the Syndicates were upset.

The Khaureds refuse to reveal where the Onoros were found or what their home planet is. The drones are so hardy and durable, they need little Trilium to survive and work on other planets, which is why they are such a profitable workforce. 

The Khaured/Onoros alliance grew larger and more powerful, with the hard-working drone crews getting bigger so they needed another layer of supervisors, a new caste of Onoros “Directors” who each managed a hundred or so drones, with the Directors then being managed by Khaured overlords. This allowed a small number of Khaureds to control - through the Directors - large numbers of Onoros Drones, further increasing the effectiveness of their operations.

The questions grew to a clamor in the Galactic Senate, and even the Altans had no idea where the Onoros came from. The Khaured insisted it was a powerful cooperative alliance, but the other races demanded answers. Finally, the Khaureds introduced another caste of Onoros, the Diplomats, who spoke for the Onoros, answered some questions in a vague manner, and represented their race in the government & in political agreements. But these Diplomat-caste Onoros were merely puppets of the Khaureds. They always voted exactly the same way as the Khaureds did and agreed with whatever the Khaureds proposed.

However, a few questions were answered. The rest of the Federation learned that the Onoros are part of a hive mind, that they are all telepathically linked with a great voice, the Maxa, a peaceful unity. The idea of the Maxa, like a great mental warm blanket, inspired some humans and other races to long for the same kind of enlightenment, but only Onoros could truly hear the voice of the Maxa. 

Rumors started that some strung-out Trilium junkies (Trillers) - people, mostly humans, who took too much highly refined Trilium or were jacked up on the augmentations, also started to hear a whispering voice in the background, a mind greater than anything they could imagine. Some of these junkies discovered after interacting with Onoros Drones that they were thinking on the same wavelength. (Imagine a desperate strung-out human indentured slave on Magor, blowing all his money on extra Trilium suddenly starting to hear the voice…) These Trillers started to think that they too were tapping into the thought-sound of the great hive mind. It was like a religious experience as they felt comforted as part of the greater whole…but they were being brainwashed.

This led other desperate seekers and pilgrims buying more and more of the refined Trilium to try to break through (think of people strung out in old opium dens, but these ones are trying to “speak to the Maxa”). Some of them became gurus, claiming to dispense wisdom of the Maxa to all races.  Then things got even more disturbing as they realized they were hearing a cry for help. “Free me!”
##### Commentary
*Story ideas for consideration.*

Some drone workers are captured and indentured into other races’ Trilium operations (imagine a pirate raid on a Khaured camp, Khaureds are killed, drones kidnapped—but the drones refuse to work for them, just standing there until they die…

As time goes on, we will learn the real devastating secret—that Khaured explorers encountered the Onoros homeworld, found the Maxa and captured it, holding it prisoner and forcing the Onoros to do their will, enslaving them as inexhaustible workers. The Khaureds threaten to kill the Maxa if the Onoros don’t do as they are commanded. They force the Maxa to pare off elements of the Onoros workers to create new castes to suit their agenda: the Directors & Diplomats. These new caste members are little more than puppets the same as the Drones, but the Maxa voice has been reaching out, begging for help. Finally as human mental walls are thinned and crumbling in people who use too much highly refined Trilium, the Maxa’s desperate message gets out…although humans can’t quite understand what they’re hearing.

This could lead to a revolution or an infiltration of the Onoros homeworld, with fanatical human converts trying to free the Maxa. The drones can rise up and fight against their Khaured captors.
### LOPATI
#### The Planet and Race
The Lopati evolved on the small, low-gravity planet of Lopat which orbited a brown dwarf on the outer edge of its habitable zone, and are a tall slim-statured race with small, deep-set eyes and thick, tough skin capable of weathering extreme cold. The surface landscape was ice-covered, with life initially evolving in a thermally thawed subsurface ocean, and then eventually in subterranean cave systems where the resultant Lopati built primitive communities. At this early stage of evolution the Lopati developed the ability to “die” at will, shutting down their metabolic processes and entering a state of dormancy much like a tardigrade. This allowed their communities to cope during times of extreme desperation where food and other resources were incredibly scarce.

As their technology advanced they branched upwards to the planet’s surface, discovering harvestable life forms capable of surviving the harsh conditions, and learning to construct weatherproof shelters that not only protected against the intense cold, but also the frequent storms that ravaged the surface in part due to Lopat’s highly elliptical orbit. They used a combination of underground caverns, large weatherproof shelters and greenhouses to create crop and livestock farming complexes, reducing the strain on fundamental resources. Surviving and thriving in spite of the rigors that Lopat threw at them, taught the Lopati to be hardy, resourceful and excellent problem solvers.

Eventually they evolved technologically to the point where basic flight was possible, using manned balloons capable of reaching altitudes higher than the roiling, storm-filled lower atmosphere, allowing them to start mapping Lopat’s surface from above, study weather patterns and develop forecasting & early warning systems - and also sparking their curiosity about the sky overhead with its many pinpoints of light and the muted brightness of the system’s brown dwarf. Atmospheric flight ultimately became space flight, and the Lopati began to explore the system’s planets and its sizable asteroid belt. 

They applied their hardy aesthetic and problem-solving skills to their spacecraft, making them incredibly durable and efficient, and began to construct mining communities on the larger asteroids where they discovered & mined new metals and other resources that helped to further revolutionize their technology. This technological spread throughout their system was picked up by Altan ultra-long range telescopy, piquing their interest. Initially they sent probes, but after discovering a civilization capable of space flight the Altans sent a delegation to make formal contact with the Lopati, ultimately inviting them to join the Federation.
#### The Disaster
Things were going well for the Lopati, until the advent of a celestial calamity that neither their engineers nor their Federation allies could avert. Due to gravitational changes in the system’s asteroid belt the orbit of a large asteroid shifted enough for it to collide with a small planetoid, the impact altering its orbit enough to put it on a collision course with Lopat. There was no way to destroy or divert the planetoid from its course, so Lopat was doomed - but the Lopati had a year’s warning and they, along with the Federation, worked tirelessly to extend their asteroid communities and build ark-ships in a bid to house as many of their civilization as possible.

The vast majority of the Lopati people were relocated in time - a notable exception being small communities of skeptics who refused, believing that they could “weather any storm” - and watched from the safety of the converted asteroids and ark-ships as the planetoid collided with Lopat, a process that took hours as the two bodies inexorably ground into each other. By the end only debris remained, a new hazard for the Lopati to deal with as it spread, carried by momentum from the collision and gravitation from the system’s brown dwarf.

That was two centuries ago.
#### The Aftermath and Arkhives
Given the ongoing risk Lopati leadership offered their people a choice: stay or leave. Those who opted to stay would need to reinforce their asteroid communities and find a method of moving them more out of harm’s way, and thus they received the majority of available resources to sustain themselves and facilitate necessary infrastructural changes. Those who opted to leave - a slight majority - took up residence in the fleet of Ark-ships, a cramped situation mildly alleviated by the provision of a small number of aging Federation freight vessels re-fitted for the purpose.

The preservation of the memory of Lopat and the history of the Lopati people was of incredible importance, so prior to the fleet’s departure each ship and asteroid community received a specialized data core crafted from pieces of Lopat’s debris harvested for that purpose. These “Arkhives” as they came to be known contained all Lopati knowledge, and colony leaders were required to continue updating the cores with new knowledge and experiences. These cores were kept secret from outsiders, as the Lopati feared that the less scrupulous among the Federation’s many communities might see value in stealing them, either to hold for ransom or to comb through the knowledge they contained for secrets that might afford them an edge over competitors.

Once each ship had been fitted with a hidden Arkhive the fleet split into small groups of two or three ships and scattered, the Lopati having determined that this would be a better strategy than remaining together in what other races might see as an invasive armada. The Lopati aboard the Ark-ships ultimately embraced austere, nomadic lives, searching the stars for a new place to call “home” but never truly finding it - though some found solace among the more welcoming communities of the Federation, their engineering skills and resourcefulness widely appreciated.
#### The Lopati Pilgrimage
The one thing that helped them retain their sense of species identity, was the requirement that the Ark-ships return to their home system every so often to share their new Arkhive data with the asteroid colonies - and in turn to receive the new data collected by them. This act became known as “The Pilgrimage'', and ensured all Arkhives continued to contain the sum of all Lopati knowledge and experiences. The return of an Ark-ship to the home system was a cause for celebration, with both the returning nomads and the asteroid communities devoting precious resources to the festivities.
#### The Evolution of Ark-Ships
The Ark-ships were ultimately heralded as a testament to Lopati engineering skill and resourcefulness, as the communities aboard them continued to grow and thus the demand for additional living space rose with it. Lacking the wealth or resources to simply procure or build larger vessels the Lopati became incredibly adept at locating salvage opportunities, and honed their bartering skills to a fine edge in order to procure second-hand parts, all of which they adapted and retro-fitted to their ships to increase their residential capacity. As a result the Ark-ships began to look less and less like their original design, eventually consumed by a plethora of parts sourced from all over the cosmos. Many outsiders viewed them with puzzlement, wondering how such mish-mosh vessels remained space-worthy - but others eyed them with a great deal of respect, for they were a potent demonstration of Lopati ingenuity.

*Story ideas*

1. An Ark-ship is on a Pilgrimage back to the home system to share and receive new Arkhive data, when it is beset by desperate space pirates who have received a tip-off about an item of value locked deep within the Lopati vessel. What follows is a stellar game of cat & mouse as the Lopati, lacking anything in the way of powerful weapons, seek to evade their pursuers and attempt to leverage their ingenuity to successfully escape.
### HUMANS
The federation made contact with Humans 120 years ago. That means everyone alive in the AW time period was born after first contact, and they have grown up and lived their lives in a reality where there are many other non-human races and interstellar travel, although the change is still recent enough that “in my grandparents’ day” normal Earth society was different. 

Initially, Earth was contacted when a Megacorp prospector ship found indications that our planet had Trilium. This started a “gold rush” where numerous alien ships arrived and tried to stake their claims. For humans, it was like being blasted by a firehose. Khaured work crews showed up with Onoros laborers. Altans arrived to teach us Triactor tech and to enlist human scientists in adapting the cartridges so that humans could reach their potential. 

Ultimately, it was discovered that our supposedly vast Trilium deposits were just a false positive (which was discovered after major Syndicate mining explorations arrived). Earth didn’t have Trilium, but something equivalent to fool’s gold. 

Still, humans were now part of the federation, and basic society was dramatically changed. Human entrepreneurs began to take jobs offworld, to go to the six planets to mine Trilium (which meant that they had to use Triactor tech and take Trilium themselves). By long-standing Altan policy, their tech was shared, and humans soon had stardrives and spaceships, which blew open the door for our race’s expansion. 

Trilium also allowed humans to cure all diseases and improve our physiology. But humans, being humans, are often jerks, and some tyrants created super-soldiers and started local wars; others adapted humanity or used Altan tech to change the face of our planet.

Others, though, turned their eyes and their imaginations to the stars, and our impetuous and ambitious visionaries rapidly worked their way into vital roles in the Syndicates and the galactic senate. (Imagine Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, or Elon Musk suddenly finding themselves in THIS situation.)

When poorer humans sign up to work for the Syndicates, they are basically put into indentured servitude. This is how people sell themselves to “work in the colonies for X years” until they can earn their way out of the contract, though it never turns out that way and they keep getting tricked farther and farther into debt, while given hope.
#### The Divergence
Humanity consists of three main groups: traditional Humans (Trads), the original interstellar colonists (Nordics), and those who have pursued cybernetic enhancement (Augments). There is plenty of diversity within these three groups and intermingling between them, though there are key physiological and ideological differences. Traditional Humans use Triactor Technology like everyone else in the Federation and possess diverse cultural and ideological backgrounds & perspectives with no overriding unity. 

Nordics are the descendants of humanity’s first endeavors to colonize outer space after joining the Federation. After numerous mission-related setbacks the colonists had settled on a planet orbiting a star in the Pleiades star cluster. Over time and with different, harsher environmental pressures driving generational evolution, the Nordics diverged physiologically from Humans, developing stronger bones and a more powerful musculature to cope with their home planet’s denser atmosphere. 

They had also found unity in adopting ancient cultural norms, including a pantheonic faith system, a focus on shamanic mysticism, and an overarching life code that placed emphasis on excelling at one’s destined profession as part of a deeply connected community, and the sense of honor that comes with constant dedication.

The name “Nordic” actually originated as a crude slang term, but was casually embraced by the Nordic people in lieu of them circulating the true name that they have for themselves - which they believe possesses power and is only to be shared among those of Nordic descent.

Augments are a demographic who have chosen to eschew dependency on Triactor Technology due in part to an inherent wariness of genetic manipulation, and have instead adopted the process of cybernetic enhancement, believing that this is a more logical and controllable method of “upgrading life”. That said there is diversity of rationale within the Augment community, ranging from a sizeable number who view Augmentation as a sort of niche fashion and quasi-”rebellion” against the established Triactor norms, to fundamentalists who are openly anti-Triactor and often anti-Altan as well, given their status as originators of the technology.

The more fundamental Augments believe that the “perfect” entity is only achievable through the seamless integration of advanced technology with a living organism, relentlessly pursuing cybernetic enhancement to the point where very little of their own original organic form is left. One consistent feature amongst Augments is the retention of a Human face, as they believe this aspect of humanity is a fundamental part of what separates them from pure robots. In over-zealous pursuit of perfection however, numerous Augments have ended up taking the last step and removing their Human face, rendering themselves indistinguishable from the robo-humanoid race known as the Robotrons.

In spite of their aversion to Triactor Technology, Augments still make use of refined Trilium fuel cells as power sources for their artificial enhancements, and have expended great effort in reverse-engineering Triactors in order to extract the necessary knowledge to create their own viable Trilium power-harnessing technology.

*Some story ideas*

A Human whose family lands were disrupted when the sudden Trilium “gold rush” happened. The Trilium turned out to be false, and after the Khaured prospectors strip-mined the area with their Onoros workers, now has a wasteland and generations later the Humans are still trying to replant and recover.  One character could be obsessed with finding Trilium on the land, sure that it wasn’t just a false positive, and keeps digging and searching.

A fugitive on the run, accused or sentenced of a deadly crime they didn’t commit. They escape and vanish into a large work camp mainly crewed by Onoros work gangs—but it is a place where no one will look for them. This character gets addicted to Trilium and starts hearing the Maxa “revelations” and becomes a fanatic operative or puppet.

A spoiled prince is kidnapped and sent into an Onoro work camp along with other indentured humans. He has to survive by doing things he’s never done before, but he is completely lost in the noise. A parallel story could be a deadly assassin who is hunting down the kidnapped prince, trying to find him in the swarm. A game of cat-and-mouse. (This could be a surprise, because we initially thought the kidnappers were the bad guys, but they were just trying to save and hide the prince.)
### ROBOTRONS
The backgrounds of the Robotrons are diverse, including sentient AI who have adopted a corporeal form, and Augments who have taken the final extreme step of removing the last vestige of their personhood: their faces. The “original” Robotrons, however, were discovered by the Altans inhabiting a number of ancient sites of interest on the Frontier planets, created by a long-forgotten elder race as guardians of now long-defunct technology.

The Altans were keenly interested in this ostensibly sentient artificial species, and sent a delegation to a site on Naron with a view to engaging in meaningful dialogue, hoping eventually to usher the Robotrons into the Federation. However, it rapidly became clear that their underlying programming included specific encounter-related sub-routines designed to trigger a violent chain reaction encompassing all Robotrons across all of the planets that they had been discovered on. The result: an aggressive army of cybernetic beings bent on ridding the Frontier planets of what they saw as interlopers attempting to steal the technology and knowledge of their creators.

Moving swiftly to protect their interests and those of the Federation - especially given the confirmed presence of Trilium on the Frontier planets - the Altans deployed their superior technology to quell the uprising, rendering most of the Robotrons inanimate until such time as they developed a method of nullifying the embedded aggressive sub-routines. The ultimate fate of the Robotrons was put to a vote in the Galactic Congress, which carried in favor of neutralizing any potential threat they might pose via a meticulous reprogramming initiative, after which they were allowed to integrate freely into Federation communities. They were not, however, officially recognized as a sentient race at that time - and have remained in limbo ever since, when it comes to their rights and status within the Federation.

 Regardless of whence they originate, today’s Robotrons are united under the common cause of official Federation-wide recognition as a sentient species, and the equal rights that come with such a step. Certain races have, over time, moved to stand with them in pursuit of this cause - including the Altans and Elgem - but others seek to keep them from their due recognition for both ideological and more sinister reasons. Yet others abstain from taking a side, either through disinterest or fear of the potential implications when it comes to the use of advanced artificial beings as “cheap labor” in their own communities and businesses.
## MEGACORPS AND SYNDICATES
As the federation formed and Trilium/Triactor tech allowed for massive expansion across the galaxy, massive corporations arose that capitalized on this opportunity. Thanks to Trilium and Triactor tech, all races could interact and survive on each others’ worlds, and multiracial business ventures thrived.

The Altans were the first to develop deep-space vehicles and stardrives that allowed them to travel to other inhabited planets and to continue their search for other sources of Trilium. After they met other races and showed them Trilium and Triactor tech, the need for Trilium expanded greatly, because now it wasn’t just Altans who used it, but every Federation Race. While the Altans continued their core search for Trilium sources, they also had a more altruistic goal of spreading their tech, their knowledge, and their civilization elsewhere. (A little like “spreading democracy around the world.”)

Trade of knowledge, technology, and everything in between began between these races, and these symbiotic relationships yielded a net increase in the capabilities of galactic society. It was a golden age.

The “Megacorps” formed powerful mining companies and consortiums that moved in and made huge profits on the six planets, extracting large amounts of Trilium, developing Triactor tech, processing Trilium into other uses, which quickly found a ready market—and many workers who rushed off to make their fortune in the Trilium sources.

But the Megacorps were far away, and the large operations extracting Trilium in the varied environments of the six planets grew more powerful locally. The most productive operations did not want to be beholden to the distant Megacorps, and eventually joined forces enough to form their own independence and throw off the yoke of the Megacorps. The Syndicates were responsible for producing Trilium in vast amounts to meet the ever-growing needs of the federation … but the Megacorps were the ones developing Triactor tech, making new cartridges and modifications. 

While there was great friction during a time where the Federation nearly came to a civil war, now the Megacorps and Syndicates have an uneasy codependency. 

The Syndicates grew in wealth and influence and soon they were controlling the production and distribution of Trilium across the entire federation, similar to OPEC. As more and more people of all races needed more and more Trilium, the Syndicate stranglehold became more prominent, and now Syndicates control the flow of Trilium back to the Megacorps and the federation space. 

The economic flow between Syndicates and Megacorp is basically that MCs provide Syndicates with not only the Triactor tech they need, but also an inexhaustible work force from the populations of all the federation planets. The Syndicates provide the Megacorps with a supply of refined Trilium. Syndicates move farther out as their epicenters of power shift to where the Trilium supplies are. The Syndicates are more willing to take risks and send dangerous exploration ventures farther and farther out into unexplored space, searching for new Trilium sources. Meanwhile, the Megacorps become further entrenched in the inner planets

They hate each other but they tolerate each other, a stalemate.

## TRILIUM
Trilium is an innately formless energy source with a chaotic resonance discovered by the Altans which adapts naturally to its surroundings, and is classified as the most bioreactive substance in the known universe, causing runaway mutation whenever it comes into direct contact with organic matter. It is known to exist in solid, liquid, or gas states depending on the terrain from which it is extracted. Its constant energy emission is harnessed through artificially constraining its frequency, enabling versatile applications such as augmentation through bionetics & cybernetics, deep space travel, and genetic modifications related to health - particularly disease resistance and eradication - physiological performance, telomeric reconstruction (aiding longevity), and innovative adaptations that facilitate survival in biomes otherwise hostile to life. 

The Altans, experimenting with Trilium in various states, identified specific strengths for each, with gaseous Trilium excelling as a technology power source, liquid Trilium as ideal for bionetics, and granulated solid Trilium - suspended in a stabilizing gel - used in genetic modulation.
### Introducing Triactor Technology
Trilium's volatility varies across states, with gaseous Trilium being the most volatile and having extreme mutagenic effects on any organic matter that it comes into contact with. Altans developed a refining method to lock Trilium into specific stable states and constrain its resonance frequency, identifying distinct resonances for power and genetic modification.

Triactor Technology underpins the ability to manipulate refined Trilium in useful ways, tapping into various resonances related to the recipient's race, individual characteristics, residing planet, and desired genetic modifications. Using appropriate tools and containment methods, raw Trilium can be mined and transported safely to official refineries, where it is then converted into specific locked states for different technological applications. In combination with the Altans' Triactor Technology it unlocks a spectrum of possibilities in harnessing energy, genetics, and technology.
### Triactor Jacks
The most prolific use of Triactor Technology is personal: a Triactor socket grafted onto a living organism into which genetic modulation cartridges can be slotted. These cartridges contain the three core states of refined Trilium, separated in a triangular fashion. The Triactor socket takes a reading of the organism to determine its base resonance state, and once read an array of possibilities will become available – a library of sorts along with risks and repeat applications.

Diseases, wounds, and almost all other ailments possess a particular repeating resonance. A fitted Triactor jack can be programmed to locate and identify these resonance patterns within an organism, and then calculate & administer the exact curative resonance required to heal the problem area. The jack’s abilities extend beyond curative medical applications, and can be utilised to alter or enhance an individual both physically and mentally.
### Data Cores
In order to elicit a particular desired effect a data core must be inserted into the central cavity of the Triactor jack. This core contains a specific set of genetic instructions which guide the Triactor’s augmentation of the host organism, preventing unwanted side effects and ensuring the alteration process is as power-efficient as possible

As more data are gathered on the different Federation races and the various medical issues that they can succumb to, the array of previously incurable disease, poisons and other negative bodily influences that Triactor technology is capable of dealing with continues to grow. In addition, the list of potential enhancements likewise grows longer with more complex beneficial augmentation becoming possible over time.
## TRILIUM AND WEAPONSMITHING
In the early period after the creation of the Federation when the first of the Frontier planets was discovered, colonists quickly found that the blaster weapons they typically used to protect themselves against predators functioned erratically or not at all. The Altans tested numerous theories and found conclusive evidence that Trilium’s fluctuating resonance destabilized the energy produced when charging or trying to fire a blaster, resulting in misfire, rapid dissipation, or in the worst case scenario disintegration of the weapon itself (and likely whoever was holding it). This meant that anyone using Triactor technology, powered as it was by Trilium fuel cells, was incapable of utilizing such weapons - and also were incapable of being harmed by them as their proximity to Trilium caused any energy bolts to dissipate before making contact.

With no foreseeable workaround for the problem the fledgling Federation Congress voted to  abandon the development of personal and planet-side blaster weaponry, and individuals in need of offensive weapons were relegated to more traditional staples such as swords and projectile-firing guns.
### Biometal
A monastic sect of Altans on the planet of Eyeke - known colloquially as “Greys” owing to their light greyish skin tone and the muted colors of both their clothing and their settlements, and renowned for creating all manner of weaponry from Waxon, the toughest mineral known and very hard to mine or shape without using specially tailored cutting technology - began to experiment attempting to infuse Waxon and other metals with Trilium in order to enhance the properties of the final product. These experiments were ultimately successful with the resultant alloys possessing a modicum of Trilium’s extreme bioreactivity, and capable of causing unpredictable rapid onset genetic mutation to any organic material that they came into contact with. Given such mutagenic properties, these alloys were named “biometals”.
### M-Casters & Splicers
The Eyekese Altans forged their new biometals into a variety of bladed weapons including daggers, axes and particularly swords. The process of forging such items was costly, time-consuming, and incredibly hazardous, so only the best of the Altan smiths were permitted to carry out what they termed Biometal manipulation. Collectively they were referred to as Biometal Forgemasters - or colloquially as Splicers - and the special weapons they produced were given the umbrella name of M-Casters. 

Not content with the randomized effects caused to opponents by Trilium-infused alloys, the Forgemasters sought mastery over Biometal’s mutagenic properties, modifying Triactor technology to allow it to be applied to the shaft or handle of a weapon and thus restrain Trilium’s chaotic resonance in a similar way as when applied to individuals. This facilitated the creation of a suite of weapons with very specific properties, including the legendary Galactic Fireblade - a bastard sword forged with a liquid core of Trilium-infused lava from the famous Azingoth volcano on Magor - and the brightly-glowing Star Fire Sword - a shortsword purportedly created from an alloy including an unknown metallic element found in a meteorite crater.
### The Sandmasters of Neri
A notable early client of the Splicers was a Nerinese Syndicate made up of a group of desert tribes. After centuries of war and attrition, the tribes had come together to present a unified front in the face of the arrival of Federation Syndicates and Megacorps seeking to colonize Neri, and exploit its varied resources - particularly Trilium - for their own gain. Setting aside grievances passed down through generations for so long that the true origins of the rift-causing disagreements between tribes were lost to history, the Sandmasters’ Syndicate built itself into a force to be reckoned with.

As an enduring, ritualistic sign of their unity, they sent an ambassador to the Altans of Eyeke to request the manufacture of a set of special Biometal spears, containing rare and precious grains of soul sand from the sacred temple that members of all tribes often made pilgrimages to, and where the creation of the Sandmasters’ Syndicate had taken place. The Altans agreed, and though the cost was steep, a spear was forged for each tribal leader. These Sandmaster Spears are said to be capable of commanding the sands of the Nerinese desert itself, and incidences of sandstorms springing up seemingly out of nowhere to hinder Megacorp convoys and encroaching groups from other Syndicates, are attributed to use of this power by the Sandmasters.
### The Necromancers’ Guild
Another organization that immediately saw potential in the invention of Biometals was the famous Necromancers’ Guild, a multi-racial group dedicated solely to finding a method of reversing death itself. They viewed Trilium as the fundamental key not just to reanimation of the dead, but truly bringing them back to life. Their activities were viewed with wariness, and the Altans in particular - having a wealth of experience experimenting with Trilium and dealing with many unwanted or unprecedented side effects - monitored them closely.

Over a period of decades, wealthy members of the Necromancers’ Guild approached the Splicers with blueprints of what they deemed “fatality reversal devices”, which were in fact a variety of weapons infused with Trilium and concoctions of different elements, the particulars of which the Guild guarded incredibly closely - and the Splicers kept to themselves for reasons beyond mere client confidentiality. 

The stories of these weapons being employed in attempts to bring the dead back to life abound across the Federation - notably because none of them actually function as designed, though they possess impressive capabilities nonetheless - with tales such as that of the Necromancers’ Hammer being used to try to reanimate one of the fabled Storm Giants, whispers of an M-Caster known as the Dagger of Creation capable of creating a temporary simulacrum of the wielder out of molten lava, and revelations about the powerful curative properties of the Healing Blade best the most widely disseminated. In spite of their failures, the Necromancers cling doggedly to their quest “to master the mystery that is death”, as their official Guild slogan reads.
### Ranged Weapons: R-Casters
Enterprising individuals across the Federation saw Biometal not just as material for producing close combat weaponry, but also a new evolution of ranged weapons capable of inflicting genetic devastation from a safe distance. Lacking access to the refined techniques and advanced technology utilized by the Splicers, several organizations have nonetheless managed to design crude Biometal production mechanisms, and also methods of melting down existing Biometal weapons, using both to produce a range of Trilium-infused bullets & arrow/bolt-heads, and a series of necessarily reinforced guns, bows and crossbows - known collectively as R-Casters - capable of firing them with some degree of reliability and accuracy. 

The ammo lacks the Triactor technology that restrains and guides the mutagenic impact of Trilium, and as such the effects on living organisms are unpredictable. R-casters are also somewhat prone to issues of instability, owing to the fact that the Trilium infusion process is being carried out using inferior technology, and there are gruesome reports of explosive misfires causing entire military squads to die horrifically as runaway mutation wrought havoc on their bodies.

Various factions within the Federation - including the Altans - disdain the use of such technology. However, other powerful factions such as the Khaureds routinely equip their military with R-casters, arguing that in scenarios where they are protecting land-based convoys or conducting ground assaults, ranged weapons are more effective at getting the job done successfully, and in spite of the instability issues are generally better at guaranteeing the lives of the Khaured soldiers & mercenaries wielding them.
## ALTANS
### Introducing the Altans
The Altans are the most advanced Federation race. They were the apex species on a utopian planet with no competitive pressures. This allowed them to focus on developing their minds, and look towards the greater goal of understanding the universe. They evolved in harmony with nature, developing a deep scientific knowledge of organic structures down to the microscopic level, seeing this as the key to understanding the greater whole.

They are typically tall and willowy with large, top-heavy ovoid heads, slightly enlarged eyes with acute vision, and delicate, elongated fingers that allow them to work with incredible precision. They are not a powerfully muscular species, owing to the fact that they never had to compete physically with other organisms on their home planet.

Altan society is hierarchical in nature, with individual status indicated by the complexity and visible display of operational Triactor technology. Altans of lower status typically wear more concealing clothing than their higher peers, with the most powerful Altans wearing clothing that is more ritualistic in nature and conceals very little of their genetically enhanced bodies.

Triactor-derived head paraphernalia are incredibly popular amongst Altans - with a wide variety of designs ranging from commonplace to unique and unusual - and are believed to enhance one or more of their basic senses in addition to their naturally powerful intellect. The complexity of these head adornments is perhaps the most visible marker of status among Altans.

Various other facets of Altan fashion are an homage to their reserved culture and penchant for maintaining an appreciable area of personal space, including such dress items as long-sleeved gloves or gauntlets with large protrusions - particularly near the elbow - that emphasize the notion that they are not to be approached too closely.
### Altan Architecture
Altan cities are comprised primarily of massive structures with a large amount of open, green space. The buildings combine overarching organic curves with intricate detailing, typically conforming to one or more of three primary shapes: arch, leaf & triangle.

They are capable of constructing their settlements on any terrain, easily adapting the buildings and layouts to suit the location without compromising the fundamental facets of their architectural style. Visitors to Altan cities are often left in awe of the architectural prowess on display, marveling at their ability to create gargantuan monuments whilst maintaining a sense of harmony with the natural surroundings.

The central interior spaces of most buildings are open to all and convey a feeling of vastness with incredibly high ceilings, whilst private living areas are located off these main atria. Altans typically mingle with each other and members of other races in these central spaces, with their personal dwellings being off limits to all but their closest family and allies.

Altan technology is semi-organic in nature and integrated seamlessly into all of their buildings, with heavy emphasis being placed upon complex functionality without compromising the flowing elegance of their architecture.
### Altan Vehicles
The Altans have mastered the power of flight and interstellar travel, and as such no longer both with ground vehicles at all. They largely utilize their ships as a means of transport or remote scientific enquiry, dedicating very few to combat-centric roles. All of their vessels have a semi-organic structure with smooth, seamless paneling, and range in size from tiny, short range personal transports, to gargantuan interstellar freighters and city-sized orbital platforms.

There is a great deal of visual variety across Altan vehicles in terms of shape, though they all possess common factors that make them readily distinguishable from the craft of other races. Perhaps the highest level of variation is seen amongst personal transports, with Altans creating unique chassis as symbols of fashion and status.

They possess the skill and capacity to build space-faring vessels of a size no other Federation race - bar the Lopati, whose mastery of ship-building rivals that of the Altans - is capable of reliably matching, owing to the fact that they were the first known race to begin large-scale exploration and colonization of the cosmos, branching out from Alta in search of new sources of Trilium.

Altans feel a strong sense of security when it comes to the advanced state of their technology compared to other races, and thus commit few of their resources to arming their vessels. This of course does not mean they lack any military fleet at all, though Altan warships remain an incredibly rare sight within the Federation’s borders.
## ELGEM
### Introducing the Elgem
The Elgem are one of the oldest Federation races boasting technology on par with the Khaured and only surpassed by the Altans, yet their presence is muted. They do not crave wealth, power or fame but instead prefer to fade into the background, content with having a seat at the Federation table but uninterested in the intricate dance of interstellar politics.

Their skeletal structure is more cartilage than bone, allowing them to fit into inconceivably tight spaces if they choose - making them the perfect infiltrators or assassins. They typically have smooth, almost ageless facial features and pointed ears that can vary in size based on tribe and family lineage.Their hair is an unruly mass threaded with organic flowerlike accouterments that are actually living parts of their bodies. 

These biological paraphernalia can be furled and unfurled at will, and are vibrantly coloured when in the latter state - which only occurs when they are in places where they feel at ease. When abroad - either on mission or mingling with unknown members of other races - the accouterments close up tightly to help minimize their visible presence.

There are two inarguably distinct sides to Elgem culture, and they adopt one version or the other depending upon the situation. Whilst among their own people and in places they deem “safe” they tend to be relaxed and innately frolicsome, whilst in the presence of strangers or far from their homes they are quiet and reserved, blending into the background, their short stature aiding their ability to remain unnoticed by most. Their clothing is selected to match their situation, with muted colors and hooded cloaks chosen when abroad, whilst at home their vestments border on garish, with prodigious use of vibrant colors.
### Elgem Architecture
Whilst highly intelligent and agile, the Elgem are not in fact the apex predator on their home planet, a title reserved for a strange, amorphous entity that blankets the ground on their homeworld like a living mist. It is swift, deadly, and any Elgem enveloped by it is dead within moments. As such their settlements are built among the high boughs of gargantuan trees, and are uniquely adapted to the various issues associated with tree-top life. 

They have accounted for aerodynamics, weight distribution and the need to minimize the load any individual tree has to bear, giving rise to communities compromising interconnected structures made of incredibly light, yet durable materials that spread the load across many trees. They navigate these communities via a plethora of walkways and specially designed zip-cables (known colloquially as “wizzers”) that use advanced energy flow technology to transport Elgem quickly from one part of their settlement to another.

The interiors of Elgem buildings are designed to harmonize with the natural surroundings, comprising an organic, mushroom-esque architectural style and a decorative aesthetic that incorporates a lot of plant life into the interior space, often leading to a somewhat overgrown look. Evidence of Elgem technological prowess is evident everywhere when one looks closely however, with the vast majority of furniture and other necessities being constructed of advanced ultra-light materials that help to minimize the overall load that their buildings have to bear.

Those few privileged outsiders who have witnessed Elgem settlements firsthand state that their charm lies not only in their whimsical appearance, but also in the seamless integration of advanced technology into every aspect of their design and function. This unique blend of nature-driven artistry and innovation creates an environment that is equal parts delightful and deeply practical, a reflection of the Elgem ability to balance the playful and the profound.
### Elgem Vehicles
Elgem technology is the embodiment of their unique cultural duality, exhibiting an exquisite vibrancy in its coloration when their ships traverse through recognized safe zones or engage in diplomatic endeavors. This vivid display of colors is not merely an aesthetic choice but a reflection of their openness and harmony with their surroundings in such environments. However, the technology reveals its true ingenuity when discretion becomes paramount. In scenarios necessitating stealth, their ships are capable of achieving a level of camouflage that no other Federation race can match, allowing them to move undetected.

The design of their ships draws inspiration from the natural world, echoing the elegant and often deceptive simplicity found in nature's creations. These vessels are adorned with an innovative bio-organic skin that employs chromatophores to dynamically alter the ship’s coloration. This feature enables the Elgem to adapt their vessel’s appearance at will, akin to the ability of various cephalopods to change their skin colouration and patterning according to the situation. The skin also does more than just change color; it has the ability to modify or mask various signatures that would otherwise be detectable by advanced scanning technologies.

It is important to note that this sophisticated mechanism of camouflage does not equate to true invisibility. Instead it is a highly advanced form of mimicry and masking where the ship blends into its environment, becoming virtually indistinguishable from it. This feature represents one of the pinnacles of Elgem technological advancement, and its duality - both vibrant and discreet - is a testament to their deep understanding of balance and adaptability, reflecting their cultural ethos.
## KHAUREDS
### Introducing the Khaureds
Khaureds are aptly evolved to handle the high gravity and various airborne gaseous hazards of their home planet of Khaur. Typically a stocky race with thick, pebbly skin that acts as a natural body armor, protecting them from attacks and various phenomena such as caustic gasses, and their densely packed musculature - owing to the high gravity environment in which they evolved - makes them physically powerful compared to most other Federation races. They are the only race to possess a third eye in the center of their forehead, which remains closed at most times but will open during periods of intense physical or spiritual focus.

Whilst they make excellent mercenaries and bodyguards, culturally they are incredibly focused, driven by a strong sense of purpose. As such, before a Khaured will commit to a contract - or anything that requires their services - they must be convinced that the job is worth doing. They do not simply go with the highest bidder, they will assess the the worthiness of the cause they’re being employed for; if hired as mercenaries to fight a war, they must be convinced that the war is worth fighting, or to be contracted as bodyguards for a powerful ambassador, they must be persuaded that the ambassador merits their protection. Therefore, those seeking to hire the services of a Khaured must have an excellent “sales pitch”.

Female Khaureds tend to be the brokers and negotiators, whilst males are more physically oriented - though this does not preclude there being crossover between the two sexes in terms of the roles that they perform. As a species, they are renowned as strong and relentless fighters, preferring to use hand weapons and engage in close combat - though they are also excellent marksmen thanks to the additional depth perception and triangulation capability offered by their third eye. They are almost universally cool-headed in combat making them deadly opponents that are rarely goaded into mistakes or rash action.

In terms of politics Khaureds are dedicated and intensely loyal, driven to excel at their aims. This makes them a powerful political force in the Federation, though they prefer facts and bluntness to misdirection or intrigue. They often end up being a jarring presence, interrupting the otherwise delicate dance of interstellar politics, though when Khaureds are involved things at least tend to get done (for better or worse). They are implacable and ruthless when it comes to business as well, driven by the incessant need to see ever-increasing success and measuring themselves against their peers in an ongoing battle of dedicative prowess.

An element of Khaured society bridles against the ruthless and driven aspects of their race, instead exploring creativity, philosophy and various other intellectual endeavors. These individuals have created their own sect and retreated from wider Khaured society, building fabulous communities and monasteries high in the mountains far from civilization, their intricacy and beauty a stark juxtaposition to the blocky, brutalist architecture of typical Khaured towns and cities.

Rumour has it that the spiritual Khaureds have vast, ancient libraries in their mountain retreats, along with artworks of such ethereal beauty that only those who have reached a certain level of spiritual enlightenment may look upon them, lest they be struck blind or driven mad. In order to achieve such an enlightened state, Khaured gurus spend many years with only their third central eye open, attuning themselves through it to higher planes of existence. The closer to enlightenment that they are, the milkier the third eye becomes - though this is not through advancing blindness, but a change that enables sight beyond the corporeal.
### Khaured Architecture
The gravity on Khaur is such that the Khaureds were forced to create robust structures lacking typical decorative paraphernalia found across the architectural styles of other races. This coupled with their penchant for function over form and general lack of artistic drive, has resulted in a brutalist style of architecture that looms imposingly over the landscape. Typical Khaured structures are akin to fortresses, thick-walled and constructed from highly durable materials.

The hard, brutalist lines of Khaured architecture carry through into their building interiors, and like the exteriors there are no unnecessary frills. Everything inside a Khaured building must serve some sort of purpose, and as such even the private quarters of Khaured individuals lack much in the way of decoration. The one exception to this is owing to the deep-seated need to show pride in their accomplishments, hence most Khaureds have a personal display case where they keep trophies from their endeavors, the majority of which are weapons or select parts taken from vanquished foes.

Spiritualist Khaureds seek to be the exception to the regimented, soulless norms of their race in every way, including their approach to architecture. Whilst they cannot completely eschew the need for robust construction, and likewise are unable to add fragile decorations to the outside of their buildings, they seek to add as much artistic flair to the construction of their buildings as possible. Visually they are still immediately recognizable as Khaured, but grander and with attention paid to details that beautify their form.

These Spiritualist retreats are also built in areas deemed to be of great natural beauty, whereas typical Khaureds pay no attention to such things, instead strictly reviewing the tactical pros and cons of the terrain upon which they wish to build.

The interiors of Spiritualist citadels are spacious and structurally detailed, with generous use of what - to Khaureds at least - are deemed as vibrant colors, and placement of artworks where possible. There is still a practicality to these interiors, but they strive to be warm, welcoming and appealing to the eye. There are public spaces where Khaureds are encouraged to gather, socialize and enjoy a much more varied cuisine than could ever be found in a typical Khaured city. There are also areas dedicated purely to spiritual cultivation, designed to offer a tranquil environment for would-be gurus to achieve mastery over the ethereal plane.
### Khaured Vehicles
The technological development of the Khaureds has always focused heavily on military application, and their spacefaring craft are formidable in every respect with the densest loadouts of weaponry of any of the Federation races, and powerful ablative hull designs that allow them to weather heavy incoming fire. The Vanguard battle-cruiser is perhaps the most impressive of their large vessels, possessing an array of cannons & missile launchers, and several ultra-long range artillery capable of planetary bombardment from high orbit.

In addition to their larger brute force spacecraft the Khaureds are also well known for their small dogfighting craft, with individual pilots demonstrating almost unmatchable skill in part owing to their extra depth perception and quickened reflexes in lower gravity environments.

The Khaured penchant for building bipedal and quadrupedal mechanoids for ground-based campaigns has been the subject of some debate, as ostensibly wheeled or tracked ground vehicles are more practical. However, upon witnessing one of these mechs being piloted it becomes immediately clear that they suit the Khaured nature perfectly, offering more diverse functionality and the ability to reach locations no other ground vehicle could. The Khaureds treat their mechs as extensions of their own bodies, with military versions typically being bipeds carrying both mech-sized handheld cannons and melee weapons such as swords and axes capable of inflicting devastating damage in close combat. Colonization mechs are typically quadrupeds carrying the necessities for constructing new outposts, though they also tend to be equipped with turret-mounted cannons for defense.
## ONOROS
### Introducing the Onoros
The Onoros worker caste - the Drones - are humanoid with roundish, noseless faces, a pair of enlarged eyes capable of accurate vision in near complete darkness, small pointy-tipped ears thought to be among the more sound-sensitive of Federation races, and a very small pair of antennae that it is speculated facilitate telepathy. They are small statured and can eat just about anything, needing only small quantities of sustenance due to their low metabolic rate and a lightweight musculature that requires little energy. 

They can thrive in a broad temperature spectrum, from cold to hot, wet to dry, and breathe a variety of atmospheres - and these abilities are enhanced by the larger, specially designed exosuits that they use for many activities. Between their natural resilience and the protective encasement of their exosuits, Onoros can go to a wide range of worlds with minimal Trilium required for survival or bodily maintenance. This makes them an excellent workforce, a fact that the Khaureds have made prodigious use of since the formation of an alliance between the two races.

The “success” of the Onoros alliance with the Khaureds resulted in an increasingly large proliferation of Drone workforces throughout Khaured-owned or controlled operations. It reached the point where the Khaureds no longer had enough of their own people to commit to managing such large groups of Drones, so a new “Director” caste was conceived to assist with day-to-day operations. These Director Onoros were tasked with overseeing one hundred-strong units of drones on behalf of Khaured site or facility managers, allowing a small number of Khaureds to more effectively manage thousands of Drones with little, if any disruption to operations.

The pace at which the alliance was spreading led to intensifying demands for answers from other races - with some questioning why the Khaureds appeared to be receiving the lion’s share of profits, and always spoke for the Onoros in the Federation Congress. The Khaureds attempted to remain vague in answering such questions, and keep as many of the specific details of their alliance veiled as possible - but evasiveness had never been a strength among Khaureds, even their politicians, so they needed another means of quelling the rising tide of queries. 

As a result the Diplomat caste of Onoros was eventually ushered into the Federation Congress to officially represent the race and its interests, though as it became clear that they followed the Khaured lead in all political matters they came to be viewed as little more than Khaured puppets, on display purely to mollify other Federation members, allowing the Khaureds to deflect further probing questions by telling enquiring politicians to raise their concerns with the Onoros directly.
### Onoros Exosuits
Whilst Onoros drones were stronger and more robust than they looked they still could not match the strength of a Khaured, and those tasks a single Khaured could perform often took the labor of two or three Onoros. Whilst this was not a major issue per se owing to the large number of drones available for tasks, the Khaureds were intent on continuing to increase the efficiency of their operations to further dominate the mining and resource extraction industries. 

As such they decided to share a limited, humanoid-scale version of their Mech technology, assisting in the construction of small mechanized exosuits that Onoros drones could pilot. These “miniature” Mechs are about the size of a typical Khaured, with the drone sitting in essentially a cockpit inside the head and chest cavity, the arms and legs being completely mechanical.

The exosuits are designed exclusively for the completion of a variety of labor-related tasks including mining, general gathering activities, simple reconnaissance and the construction of temporary or permanent structures as-needed by the Khaured operation in question. They were created to be versatile with some modularity allowing them to be rapidly refitted and re-kitted in the field for the particular job that a drone has been assigned. 

The Khaureds ensured that they are universally equipped with terrain and atmospheric sensors allowing the drones inside to locate desired resources, and avoid potentially hazardous scenarios. The latter functionality was less to do with the safety of the drone pilot (given the seemingly endless supply of drones) and more about the value of the exosuit itself - and of course the potential for lost productivity should one or more exosuits be rendered inoperable for any length of time.
### The Maxa
The Onoros share a distance-less telepathic connection - an interstellar hive mind - all ultimately connected to a single apex Onoros: a genderless Maxa who has come to be perceived by outsiders as a deity exerting benign control over them. This deep, race-wide connection is thought to be a major reason why Onoros have subdued personalities, are typically docile with little emotional range, and all look so physically similar. Little is known about how new Onoros come into being, but it is speculated that the Maxa plays a central role.

The Onoros Diplomats ushered in to participate in the Federation Congress are ostensibly the voice of the Maxa in all matters relating to their race, though questions remain concerning the fact that such a seemingly benign entity would so closely ally its race with the Khaureds.

Originally the fact that the Onoros were a race with a single hive mind had been kept a secret by the Khaureds. However at some point the knowledge was leaked, spreading across the Federation like wildfire, and in dismay the Khaured had little choice but to corroborate this revelation. Over time the concept of the Maxa-controlled hive mind inspired members of other races to pursue what they deemed to be a form of enlightenment, and they tried in vain to assume a state in which they too could hear the voice of the Maxa.

There is a lingering concern among some that the Maxa may have a hidden agenda. With Onoros drones scattered throughout the Federation, whispers abound about the true intentions of this seemingly peaceful race. Conspiracists see the spread of Onoros throughout the Megacorps and Syndicates as a series of deliberate placements and consequently stoke unease among their own communities and peers, leaving parts of the Federation a little on edge, wondering if the tranquility is merely a facade covering a more insidious motive - and also how the Khaureds fit into such a narrative.
## LOPATI
### Introducing the Lopati
The Lopati evolved on the small, low-gravity planet of Lopat which orbited a brown dwarf on the outer edge of its habitable zone, and are a tall slim-statured race with small, deep-set eyes and thick, tough skin capable of weathering extreme cold. The surface landscape was ice-covered, with life initially evolving in a thermally thawed subsurface ocean, and then eventually in subterranean cave systems where the resultant Lopati built primitive communities. At this early stage of evolution the Lopati developed the ability to “die” at will, shutting down their metabolic processes and entering a state of dormancy much like a tardigrade. This allowed their communities to cope during times of extreme desperation where food and other resources were incredibly scarce.

As their technology advanced they branched upwards to the planet’s surface, discovering harvestable life forms capable of surviving the harsh conditions, and learning to construct weatherproof shelters that not only protected against the intense cold, but also the frequent storms that ravaged the surface in part due to Lopat’s highly elliptical orbit. They used a combination of underground caverns, large weatherproof shelters and greenhouses to create crop and livestock farming complexes, reducing the strain on fundamental resources. Surviving and thriving in spite of the rigors that Lopat threw at them, taught the Lopati to be hardy, resourceful and excellent problem solvers.
### Lopati Technology
Eventually they evolved technologically to the point where basic flight was possible, using manned balloons capable of reaching altitudes higher than the roiling, storm-filled lower atmosphere, allowing them to start mapping Lopat’s surface from above, study weather patterns and develop forecasting & early warning systems - and also sparking their curiosity about the sky overhead with its many pinpoints of light and the muted brightness of the system’s brown dwarf. Atmospheric flight ultimately became space flight, and the Lopati began to explore the system’s planets and its sizable asteroid belt. 

They applied their hardy aesthetic and problem-solving skills to their spacecraft, making them incredibly durable and efficient, and began to construct mining communities on the larger asteroids where they discovered & mined new metals and other resources that helped to further revolutionize their technology. This technological spread throughout their system was picked up by Altan ultra-long range telescopy, piquing their interest. Initially they sent probes, but after discovering a civilization capable of space flight the Altans sent a delegation to make formal contact with the Lopati, ultimately inviting them to join the Federation.
### Lopat’s Doom
Things were going well for the Lopati, until the advent of a celestial calamity that neither their engineers nor their Federation allies could avert. Due to gravitational changes in the system’s asteroid belt the orbit of a large asteroid shifted enough for it to collide with a small planetoid, the impact altering its orbit enough to put it on a collision course with Lopat. There was no way to destroy or divert the planetoid from its course, so Lopat was doomed - but the Lopati had a year’s warning and they, along with the Federation, worked tirelessly to extend their asteroid communities and build ark-ships in a bid to house as many of their civilization as possible.

The vast majority of the Lopati people were relocated in time - a notable exception being small communities of skeptics who refused, believing that they could “weather any storm” - and watched from the safety of the converted asteroids and ark-ships as the planetoid collided with Lopat, a process that took hours as the two bodies inexorably ground into each other. By the end only debris remained, a new hazard for the Lopati to deal with as it spread, carried by momentum from the collision and gravitation from the system’s brown dwarf.

Given the ongoing risk Lopati leadership offered their people a choice: stay or leave. Those who opted to stay would need to reinforce their asteroid communities and find a method of moving them more out of harm’s way, and thus received the majority of available resources to sustain themselves and facilitate necessary infrastructural changes. Those who opted to leave - a slight majority - took up residence in the fleet of Ark-ships, a cramped situation mildly alleviated by the provision of a small number of aging Federation freight vessels re-fitted for the purpose.
### Arkhives
The preservation of the memory of Lopat and the history of the Lopati people was of incredible importance, so prior to the fleet’s departure each ship and asteroid community received a specialized data core crafted from pieces of Lopat’s debris harvested for that purpose. These “Arkhives” as they came to be known contained all Lopati knowledge, and colony leaders were required to continue updating the cores with new knowledge and experiences. These cores were kept secret from outsiders, as the Lopati feared that the less scrupulous among the Federation’s many communities might see value in stealing them, either to hold for ransom or to comb through the knowledge they contained for secrets that might afford them an edge over competitors.

Once each ship had been fitted with a hidden Arkhive the fleet split into small groups of two or three ships and scattered, the Lopati having determined that this would be a better strategy than remaining together in what other races might see as an invasive armada. The Lopati aboard the Ark-ships ultimately embraced austere, nomadic lives, searching the stars for a new place to call “home” but never truly finding it - though some found solace among the more welcoming communities of the Federation, their engineering skills and resourcefulness widely appreciated. 

The one thing that helped them retain their sense of species identity, was the requirement that the Ark-ships return to their home system every so often to share their new Arkhive data with the asteroid colonies - and in turn to receive the new data collected by them. This act became known as “The Pilgrimage'', and ensured all Arkhives continued to contain the sum of all Lopati knowledge and experiences. The return of an Ark-ship to the home system was a cause for celebration, with both the returning nomads and the asteroid communities devoting precious resources to the festivities.
## HUMANS
### Introducing Humans
A century ago, a Megacorp mining ship’s deep space sensors discovered telltale energy signatures indicating a sizeable Trilium deposit on Earth. As a result the Federation sent a delegation to Earth to make contact with humanity and determine if the readings were correct. They turned out to be a false positive - there was no Trilium on Earth - but the Altans saw potential in Humans and extended them an invite to the Federation. This dramatically changed Human society, revolutionizing medicine, space travel, and accelerating their journey to the stars. However, this era also gave rise to more questionable practices like super-soldier programs, and risky ecosystem modifications that caused environmental harm. Influential visionaries, reminiscent of 21st century entrepreneurs, became key players in galactic politics - yet despite the myriad advancements many humans found themselves in a bleak reality, bound in servitude to mighty galactic syndicates and megacorps, highlighting the complex nature of the Federation and humanity’s place within it.

#### Trads
Human society is primarily divided into three distinct groups: Traditional Humans (Trads), who maintain the original human form; the Nordics, the pioneering interstellar colonists; and the Augments, individuals who have embraced cybernetic enhancement. Each group exhibits differing levels of diversity and there is significant intermixing between the three, yet they are marked by notable physiological and philosophical differences. Traditional Humans, whilst they have embraced Triactor Technology like the rest of the Federation, are characterized by their varied cultural and ideological perspectives. 

They lack a singular unifying identity, instead showcasing a mosaic of stances and beliefs shaped by their individual experiences and histories. This is both a strength and weakness for Trads, as whilst it allows them to more easily adapt and integrate into varied Federation communities, it leaves some vulnerable to more predatory ideologies - hence the rising prevalence of Humans among those indentured to powerful entities in interstellar corporate and political arenas.
#### Nordics
Nordics are the descendants of humanity’s first endeavors to colonize outer space after joining the Federation. After numerous mission-related setbacks the colonists had settled on a planet orbiting a star in the Pleiades star cluster. Over time and with different, harsher environmental pressures driving generational evolution, the Nordics diverged physiologically from Humans, developing stronger bones and a more powerful musculature to cope with their home planet’s denser atmosphere. 

They had also found unity in adopting ancient cultural norms, including a pantheonic faith system, a focus on shamanic mysticism, and an overarching life code that placed emphasis on excelling at one’s destined profession as part of a deeply connected community, and the sense of honor that comes with constant dedication.

The name “Nordic” actually originated as a crude slang term, but was casually embraced by the Nordic people in lieu of them circulating the true name that they have for themselves - which they believe possesses power and is only to be shared among those of Nordic descent.
#### Augments
Augments are a demographic who have chosen to eschew dependency on Triactor Technology - due in part to an inherent wariness of genetic manipulation - and have instead adopted the process of cybernetic enhancement, believing that this is a more logical and controllable method of “upgrading life”. That said there is diversity of rationale within the Augment community, ranging from a sizeable number who view Augmentation as a sort of niche fashion and “quasi-rebellion” against the established Triactor norms, to fundamentalists who are openly anti-Triactor and often anti-Altan as well, given their status as inventors of the technology.

The more fundamental Augments believe that the “perfect” entity is only achievable through the seamless integration of advanced technology with a living organism, relentlessly pursuing cybernetic enhancement to the point where very little of their own original organic form is left. One consistent feature amongst Augments is the retention of a Human face, as they believe this aspect of humanity is a fundamental part of what separates them from pure robots. In over-zealous pursuit of perfection however, numerous Augments have ended up taking the last step and removing their face, rendering themselves indistinguishable from the robo-humanoid race known as the Robotrons, whose collective many ultimately join.

In spite of their aversion to Triactor Technology, Augments still make use of refined Trilium fuel cells as power sources for their artificial enhancements, and have expended great effort in reverse-engineering Triactors in order to extract the necessary knowledge to create their own viable Trilium power-harnessing technology.
### Civilization
Prior to admission to the Federation, people had been increasingly concentrating within the bounds of large cities, owing in large part to a lack of opportunities in more rural areas. Federation membership has not changed this trend, but access to new technology is helping to solve the inevitable pollution issues associated with such incredibly high population densities.

Humanity initially possessed rudimentary space-faring abilities, capable of intra-system flight and the construction of basic working colonies on asteroids, moons and certain other planets within the solar system. Access to Federation knowledge and technology allowed humanity to leapfrog into a new era of space exploration and habitation. 

More affluent Humans, benefiting greatly from these advancements, moved into state-of-the-art orbital cities purpose-built to offer a comparatively utopian environment whilst catering to all of  their needs. Acquiring enough wealth or connections to gain entry to one of these cities has become a driving force for the more ambitious members of Human society, as life in orbit starkly contrasts the cramped and intensely competitive conditions in the megacities on Earth’s surface.

Many other Humans - either using their own wealth or through funding initiatives offered by megacorps and syndicates - have built lives far from Earth, with an increasing number heading out as far as the Frontier planets to join burgeoning Trilium mining communities.
### Technology
Humans are one of the few Federation races that persist in the extensive use of wheeled and tracked ground vehicles. This preference largely stems from the significantly higher production costs associated with flight-capable vehicles, whilst Human expertise in manufacturing cost-effective ground transportation continues to make it a practical choice for various terrains and circumstances. 

Recently the Khaureds expressed a keen interest in forming an alliance with humanity, offering to assist with the enhancement of their ground-based military technology. However, this overture has been met with a degree of caution and skepticism by Human politicians, their wariness stemming primarily from the markedly ambiguous nature of the existing alliance between the Khaureds and the meek-seeming Onoros. The potential implications of deepening ties with the Khaureds, particularly in the context of their current alliances, pose complex diplomatic challenges and potential geopolitical shifts that Human leaders must consider carefully before accepting or refusing such a weighted offer.

Human aircraft and spacecraft manufacturers have progressively integrated Federation energy and flight technology into their designs, significantly enhancing speed, maneuverability, and both offensive and defensive capabilities. This technological evolution was exemplified by the completion of the first Juggernaut class space carrier - the HSF Alcazar - which was viewed as a monumental achievement in human engineering. 

The multi-year project involved a collaborative effort between Human engineers and specialists from the Altan and Elgem races, two prominent species within the Federation known for their advanced technological prowess, and their involvement as consultants was pivotal as they ensured the seamless integration of Federation technology into the space carrier's design. Their expertise was instrumental in upgrading the Alcazar's systems and teaching the Human crew to properly interface with what, to them, was new and unusual technology. 

The launch of the HSF Alcazar marked a significant milestone for humanity, and in spite of being centuries behind various other Federation races in terms of technology, the cruiser was a formidable presence encouraging the acceptance of Humans on a more equal footing.
## ROBOTRONS
### Introducing Robotrons
The backgrounds of the Robotrons are diverse, including sentient AI who have adopted a corporeal form, and Augments who have taken the final extreme step of removing the last vestige of their personhood: their faces. The “original” Robotrons, however, were discovered by the Altans inhabiting a number of ancient sites of interest on the Frontier planets, created by a long-forgotten elder race as guardians of now long-defunct technology.

The Altans were keenly interested in this ostensibly sentient artificial species, and sent a delegation to a site on Naron with a view to engaging in meaningful dialogue, hoping eventually to usher the Robotrons into the Federation. However, it rapidly became clear that their underlying programming included specific encounter-related sub-routines designed to trigger a violent chain reaction encompassing all Robotrons across all of the planets that they had been discovered on. The result: an aggressive army of cybernetic beings bent on ridding the Frontier planets of what they saw as interlopers attempting to steal the technology and knowledge of their creators.

Moving swiftly to protect their interests and those of the Federation - especially given the confirmed presence of Trilium on the Frontier planets - the Altans deployed their superior technology to quell the uprising, rendering most of the Robotrons inanimate until such time as they developed a method of nullifying the embedded aggressive sub-routines. The ultimate fate of the Robotrons was put to a vote in the Galactic Congress, which carried in favor of neutralizing any potential threat they might pose via a meticulous reprogramming initiative, after which they were allowed to integrate freely into Federation communities. They were not, however, officially recognized as a sentient race at that time - and have remained in limbo ever since, when it comes to their rights and status within the Federation..
### Culture
Robotron culture is comparatively in its infancy compared to any of the other Federation races. The Altan reprogramming of their prime directive was liberative in certain respects, as for the first time the original Robotrons were no longer compelled to act as guardians of the ancient, decaying ruins of their creators. Their naivete when it came to interactions with other races led to their exploitation by certain less scrupulous organizations, though through experience and an evolving social awareness, more and more Robotrons have become wise to such exploits and reject offers that they analyze as being dubious in nature.

The transition of members of the Augment community into becoming fully Robotron has furthermore helped to inject certain minor cultural elements from different races, and whilst to outsiders the visible impact is muted, the Robotron community itself sees such inclusions as transformative (they just lack the complex emotional programming to show it).
### Technology
Robotron spacecraft have a distinct, monolithic look to them, and internal spaces are typically spartanly furnished owing to the lack of desire for the cultural and nostalgic trappings associated with other races. These enormous skyscraper-esque spacecraft both facilitate interstellar travel, and act as orbital or grounded outposts for the Robotrons whilst they carry out whatever mission or endeavor they are engaged in.

Owing to their reprogramming Robotrons do not have military capabilities to speak of, though they are adept at manufacturing unmanned drones and vehicles that they are able to control through a built-in communications array allowing them to relay commands wirelessly. There is high demand for such technology among mining communities in more hazardous regions that remain inhospitable to organic lifeforms regardless of Triactor-based enhancements.
### Robotrons and the Federation
Regardless of whence they originate, today’s Robotrons are united under the common cause of official Federation-wide recognition as a sentient species, and the equal rights that come with such a step. Certain races have, over time, moved to stand with them in pursuit of this cause - including the Altans and Elgem - but others seek to keep them from their due recognition for both ideological and more sinister reasons. Yet others abstain from taking a side, either through disinterest or fear of the potential implications when it comes to the use of advanced artificial beings as “cheap labor” in their own communities and businesses.
